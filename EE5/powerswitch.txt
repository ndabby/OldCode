Task:         	Power Switch

Description:  	The switch (for a battery-powered system) consists of circuitry to control the power
		of the system, one switch, and two LEDs (one red and one green) that indicate the 
		system status. The power is initially off. When the switch is pressed, the power is 
		turned on for two minutes and the green LED is continuously on (after 90 seconds, the
		the green LED blinks, after 15 more seconds the the green LED goes off and the red LED 
		blinks (1 hz). After 10 more seconds the red LED blinks faster (2 hz), and after 5 
		more seconds the power is turned off as are both LEDs. If at any time the switch is 
		pressed for less than 2 seconds, the two minute timer is restarted. If the switch is
		pressed for 2 seconds or longer, the the green LED is immediately shut off and the red 
		LED will blink at 2Hz for 3 seconds before the entire system is turned off. (Another 
		key press within those three seconds will reset the power and leave the system on for 
		another two minutes).
		The program is written as an event-based where the system generates events when the switch is 			
		pushed, released, and every time 250 milliseconds pass. The program also makes use of the following
 		available tasks:
		
		Power(on:in)		The task takes a single input parameter (on) which is a logical value. 
					If true the system power is turned on and if false it is turned off.
		DisplayRedLED(on:in)	The task takes a single input parameter (on) which is a logical value. If 									true the red LED is turned on and if false it is turned off.
		DisplayGreenLED(on:in)	The task takes a single input parameter (on) which is a logical value. 
					If true the green LED is turned on and if false it is turned off.

Events:
Timer250msEvent	The event is generated every 250 milliseconds (four times per second) by the timer.
KeyPressEvent	The event is generated every time the switch is pressed.
KeyReleaseEvent	The event is generated every time the switch is released.

Steps:

   Start
      	Description: 	Idle off state, waiting for a key press event. 
			Power switch and both LEDs are turned off and all time buffers are
			reset to 0.

      	Action:      	on <- 0
			red <-0
			green <-0
			CycleZeroTime <- 0
			CycleOneTime <- 0
			CycleTwoTime <- 0
			CycleThreeTime <- 0
			QSDTime <- 0
			PressTime <-0
			PERFORM Power(on)
			PERFORM DisplayRedLED(red)
			PERFORM DisplayGreenLED(green)

   Initialize
	Description: 	The timer has just been restarted, so power is turned on and the green 
			light is on. PressTime is reset to zero if we arrive at this step from
			a step other than Start.

	Action:		on <- 1
			green <- 1
			PressTime <- 0
			PERFORM Power(on)
			PERFORM DisplayGreenLED(green)



   CycleZero
	Description: 	Counting to 90,000 milliseconds, when we will move to a powering down 
			state. 

	Action:		Cycle0Time <- Cycle0Time +o 250


   CycleOne
	Description:	Counting to 15,000 milliseconds, when we will move to the next power 
			down state. Green light blinks once per second.

	Action:		Cycle1Time <- Cycle1Time +o 250
			green <- ((Cycle1Time % 1000) = 0)
			PERFORM DisplayGreenLED(green)

   CycleTwo
	Description:	Counting to 10,000 milliseconds, when we will move to the last power 
			down state. Green light is turned off and the red light blinks once 
			per second.

	Action:		green <- 0
			Cycle2Time <- Cycle2Time +o 250
			red <- ((Cycle2Time % 1000) = 0)
			PERFORM DisplayRedLED(red)
			PERFORM DisplayGreenLED(green)
   CycleThree
	Description:	Counting to 5,000 milliseconds before shutting down.
			The red light blinks twice per second.

	Action:		Cycle3Time <- Cycle3Time +o 250
			red <- ((Cycle3Time % 500) = 0)
			PERFORM DisplayRedLED(red)
   QuickShutDown
	Description:	Counting to 3,000 milliseconds before moving to off state.
			The green light is turned off and the red light blinks twice per
			second. 

	Action:		QSDTime <- QSDTime + 250
			green <- 0
			red <- ((QSDTime % 500) = 0)	
			PERFORM DisplayRedLED(red)
			PERFORM DisplayGreenLED(green)
   KeyPressed
	Description: 	Key has been pressed, so we count up to 2000 milliseconds before 
			moving to quick shut down mode. 
			The green light is turned on and the red light is turned off.

	Action:		PressTime <- PressTime +o 250
			green <- 1
			red <- 0
			PERFORM DisplayRedLED(red)
			PERFORM DisplayGreenLED(green)
