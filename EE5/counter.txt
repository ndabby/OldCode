Task:         Saturating Counter
Description:  Increment and/or decrement a counter between two limit values.
              If the count goes above or below the limit values (999 and 0),
              it saturates at the limit value.  Thus incrementing from the
              maximum value leaves it at the maximum value and decrementing
              from the minimum value leaves it at the minimum value.  The
              counter is initialized to the middle value (500) when the task
              begins.  Note that the counter will momentarily display an
              incorrect value after it goes out of range.  The duration should
              be short enough so the incorrect value is never seen.
Initial Step: Start
Final Step:   -----


Variables:
   countValue  int[0, 999]
               current value of the counter, the range is the range of the
               counter


Events:
   CountDownEvent  the counter should count down by 1
   CountUpEvent    the counter should count up by 1


Steps:

   Start
      Description: start the counter, just initialize it to a middle value
      Action:      countValue <- 500
                   PERFORM  DisplayDecimal(countValue)

   CountDown
      Description: dounting down, decrement the counter watching for overflow
      Action:      countValue--o
                   PERFORM  DisplayDecimal(countValue)

   CountUp
      Description: counting up, increment the counter watching for overflow
      Action:      countValue++o
                   PERFORM  DisplayDecimal(countValue)

   SaturateHigh
      Description: counter has overflowed counting up, saturate at maximum
                   value
      Action:      countValue <- 999
                   PERFORM  DisplayDecimal(countValue)

   SaturateLow
      Description: counter has overflowed counting down, saturate at minimum
                   value
      Action:      countValue <- 0
                   PERFORM  DisplayDecimal(countValue)


Step Transitions:

Start          CountDown         CountUp
CountDown      CountDown         CountUp        SaturateLow
CountUp        CountDown         CountUp        SaturateHigh
SaturateLow    CountDown         CountUp
SaturateHigh   CountDown         CountUp
