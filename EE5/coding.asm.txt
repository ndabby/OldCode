;the examples use the following constants
ZERO    DB    0			;all bits 0
ONES    DB    FF                ;all bits 1
ONE     DB    1			;the value 1


;the examples use the following variables
var     DB    ?			;any variable
var2    DB    ?			;any other variable
temp    DB    ?			;temporary storage



;clear the accumulator
	NAND  ZERO		;acc = FF
	NAND  ONES		;acc = 0


;set the accumulator
	NAND  ZERO		;acc = FF


;invert the accumuator
	NAND  ONES		;acc = NOT acc


;negate the accumulator
	NAND  ONES		;acc = NOT acc
	ADD   ONE		;acc = NOT acc + 1 = -acc


;load a variable into the accumulator
	NAND  ZERO		;acc = FF
	NAND  var		;acc = NOT var
	NAND  ONES		;acc = var


;check accumulator for 0 (destructive)
	ADD   ONES		;acc = acc + FF
	JNC   HaveZero		;jumps if accumlator was zero


;clear the carry flag
	JNC   Next		;jump to next instrution, clears carry
Next:


;logical AND of accumulator with a variable
	NAND  var		;logical NAND
	NAND  ONES		;invert it to get AND


;logical OR of accumulator with a variable
	NAND  ONES		;invert the accumulator
	ST    temp		;store it for later
	NAND  ZERO		;acc = FF
	NAND  var		;acc = NOT var
	NAND  temp		;acc = NOT (NOT var AND NOT acc) = var OR acc


;subtract two variables (var - var2)
	NAND  ZERO		;acc = FF
	NAND  var2		;acc = NOT var2
	ADD   ONE		;acc = NOT var2 + 1 = -var
	ADD   var		;acc = var - var2


;swap var and var2
	NAND  ZERO		;acc = FF
	NAND  var		;acc = NOT var
	ST    temp		;temp = NOT var
	NAND  ZERO		;acc = FF
	NAND  var2		;acc = NOT var2
	NAND  ONES		;acc = var2
	ST    var		;var = var2
	NAND  ZERO		;acc = FF
	NAND  temp		;acc = NOT temp = NOT NOT var = var
	ST    var2		;var2 = var
