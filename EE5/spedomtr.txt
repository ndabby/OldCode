Task:         Speedometer
Description:  Compute and display the current speed of the system based
              on the timing of revolutions.
Initial Step: Start
Final Step:   -----


Variables:
   distance   fixed point
              the distance traveled thus far
   CIRCUM     fixed point  constant
              circumference of the wheel
   TIMESCALE  fixed point  constant
              scale factor to convert distance to speedometer units


Events:
   RevolutionEvent  a revolution has occurred
   TimeoutEvent     timer has timed out (time interval has occurred)


Steps:

   Start
      Description: start the calculation of speed, counting how many
                   revolutions occur between timer timeouts
      Action:      distance <- 0.0
                   PERFORM ResetTimer

   Measure
      Description: measure the speed by measuring the distance travelled
                   (or counting revolutions) between timer timeouts
      Action:      distance <- distance + CIRCUM

   Display
      Description: compute and display the current speed then get ready for
                   the next speed calculation
      Action:      PERFORM  Display(speed <- distance / TIMESCALE)
                   distance <- 0.0
