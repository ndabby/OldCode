Task:         Digital Clock
Description:  Compute and display the current time in a 24-hour display 
              of hours and minutes. The colon between the hours and minutes 
	      blinks on for one second and off for the next second (at 0.5 Hz).
	      This is a condition based program. The program also utilizes the
	      already defined tasks-- DisplayColon and DisplayTime.
Initial Step: Start
Final Step:   -----


Variables:
   MIN	      int[0, 59]
	      records minutes elapsed in the current hour
   HR	      int[0, 23]
	      records hours elapsed in the current day
   SEC	      int[0, 59]
	      records seconds elapsed in current minute
   ON	      logical 
	      records whether the colon is on

Events:
   Timer1sElapsed(timeout:out)	The task determines whether a second has elapsed 
				on the timer since the last time it was called. 
				It takes a single output parameter (timeout) in 
				which true is stored if one second has elapsed 
				and in which false is stored otherwise. Once the 
				task has given a value of true it will not yield 
				a true value again until a second has elapsed.


Steps:

   Start
      Description: 	Either the clock has just been turned on, and hence we 
			start the calculation of time, or it is a new day. 
			Initialize clock to 00:00
      Action:      hr <- 00
		   min <- 00
		   sec <-00
		   on <- 1
                   PERFORM DisplayTime
		   PERFORM DisplayColon

   CountUp
      Description: 	A second has passed, increment seconds
      Action:      sec <- sec + 1
		   PERFORM DisplayTime
		   PERFORM DisplayColon


   NewMinute
	Description: 	A minute has passed, increment minutes
	Action:	   sec <- 00
		   min <- min + 1
   		   PERFORM DisplayTime
		   PERFORM DisplayColon

   NewHour
	Description: 	An hour has passed, increment hours
	Action:	   sec <- 00
		   min <- 00
		   hr <- hr + 1
   		   PERFORM DisplayTime
		   PERFORM DisplayColon

Step Transitions:

           Timer1sElapsed    	sec > 59    	min > 59	hr>23
