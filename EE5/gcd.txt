Task:         GCD
Description:  Compute the GCD of the passed parameters using Euclid's
              Algorithm
Initial Step: CheckParams
Final Step:   Done


Parameters:
   a    integer   in
        one value for which to compute the GCD
   b    integer   in
        second value for which to compute the GCD
   GCD  integer   out
        result - the GCD of a and b, 0 if a or b is non-positive


Steps:

   CheckParams
      Description: check the parameters for valid values and initialize
                   the result (GCD) to 0, the error value
      Action:      GCD <- 0

   Compute
      Description: compute one step of the GCD algorithm, reducing the
                   larger value (a) by the smaller value (b)
      Action:      a <- a - b

   Swap
      Description: adjust a back to positive and then swap with b so b
                   is always the smallest of the two values
      Action:      a <- a + b
                   a <-> b

   HaveGCD
      Description: have computed the GCD, store it for return
      Action:      GCD <- b

   Done:
      Description: have the GCD, done with the computation
      Action:      nothing


Step Transitions:

             (a > 0) & (b > 0)   a = 0    a < 0    otherwise
